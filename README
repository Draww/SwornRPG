Optional TagAPI integration:
	If you are an experienced coder, you might want to take a look at the class "TagListener"
	This listener lays the framework for changing the Tag above your head, just plug in your IGN and then what you want it to show up as.
	Considering the way that Bukkit handles nametags, the output nametag must be the same as your IGN or you will show up as steve.
